  * Fixed an issue where the first list entry marker is colored differently.
  * Some minor issues ([#206][], [#207][], [#208][])
  * "Add Missing Link Labels" command was always re-adding labels that contains regex special chars. Fixed. ([#230][]).
  
  ## New Features
  
  * Indenting or unindenting multiple lines on unnumbered lists will cycle list symbols.
  * Color support for [Git Gutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter).
  * Added lint feature for Markdown files. Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` (`⌘+⇧+M`) or type `MarkdownEditing: Markdown Lint` in the command pallette to try it (by @felixhao28). Check [this document][lint-rules] for the supported rules.
  * Fenced code blocks now support Lua highlighting (thanks @amclain !).

  Notes
  -----
  
  For the next major version of SublimeCodeIntel (v3.0.0) you will have to ensure
  that CodeIntel package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CodeIntel) is installed on
  your system usually by using pip or easy_install. The Code intelligence will be
  handled by that package and the command ``codeintel`` it will install.
  
  
  Please start trying to install the CodeIntel package as soon as possible to make
  sure you are ready for the upcoming version of SublimeCodeIntel:
  
  1. Install Python 2 and pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).
  
  2. Install (or upgrade) ``CodeIntel`` by typing the following in a terminal: ``pip install -U codeintel``
  
  
  ** Restart Sublime Text after reading this **
